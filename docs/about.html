    <p>
      Ours is a story of patience and serendipity. We attended the same college, hung out with the same groups, and yet we never met. Our selfs needed to wander a bit longer, to form and grow.
    <p>
      Ashley went off to grad school at WVU and Danny left Ohio for a job in Kansas City and later, New York. Years passed, both of us focused on building our careers. Danny moved back to Columbus in 2020, and our first date at Schiller Park was not too long after. 
    <p>
      We discovered that both our childhoods were filled with the same outdoor adventures - building forts in the woods, catching frogs in the creek, and neighborhood games of capture the flag. Our bond grew strong over this shared love of nature, so strong we embarked on a 6 week roadtrip across the country. We camped under the bright stary sky in Yellowstone and put our toes in the Pacific Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our engagement, at Saguaro National Park, was a perfect reflection of our relationship. A quiet moment together in the desert, among the giant cacti. Danny proposed during a hike, and Ashley, thankfully, said yes!

      We would like out next chapter to start surrounded by friends and family. We invite you to beautiful Hocking Hills to be a apart of our marriage celebration.
